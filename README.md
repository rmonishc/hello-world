# hello-world
This is the first repository I am creating on github

I am a Material Engineer with a strong motivation in programming and data analysis. I am developping my expertise in Data Science and Machine learning to solve practical problems, and using Python for automating industrial analysis tasks. I am also diverging into using Python for data-driven Process Optimisation.
